# How to Track Chit Investments

## What is a Chit?

A chit is a traditional savings and investment scheme where:
- You pay a **fixed amount monthly** (e.g., ₹5,000/month)
- After a period (e.g., 30 months), you get back a **lump sum**
- You get "your turn" to withdraw money during the chit period
- It's a common savings method in India

## How to Track in Finance Tracker

### Option 1: Track Monthly Payments as Separate Investments (Recommended)

This method gives you a clear view of each payment and the chit's progress.

**Step 1: Add First Payment**
1. Go to **Investments** tab
2. Click **+ Add Investment**
3. Fill in:
   - **Name**: e.g., "XYZ Chit - Month 1" or "ABC Chit Group"
   - **Type**: Select **"Chit"** (newly added)
   - **Amount Invested**: Your monthly payment (e.g., ₹5,000)
   - **Current Value**: Same as invested amount (₹5,000)
   - **Date**: Payment date (e.g., 2025-12-01)
   - Leave other fields blank
4. Click **Save**

**Step 2: Add Monthly Payments**
Repeat Step 1 for each month:
- **Name**: e.g., "XYZ Chit - Month 2", "XYZ Chit - Month 3", etc.
- Update the **Date** for each payment
- This creates a clear audit trail of all payments

**Step 3: Track Chit Value Growth**

Once you receive your payout or know the current value:
1. Go back to the first chit entry
2. Click **Edit**
3. Update **Current Value** to the chit's current worth
4. For example:
   - Invested: ₹5,000 × 6 months = ₹30,000
   - Current Value: ₹32,000 (if dividend added or payout received)

**Step 4: View on Dashboard**
- **Dashboard** shows total invested in chits
- **Investments tab** shows all chit payments with month filter
- Select the month to see that month's chit payment

### Option 2: Single Entry per Chit Group

If you prefer a simplified view:

**One Entry for Entire Chit:**
1. Name: "XYZ Chit - 30 Month Plan" 
2. Type: **Chit**
3. Amount Invested: ₹30,000 (total for all 30 months)
4. Date: Start date
5. Update Current Value monthly as you add money

**Pros**: Simpler, less entries
**Cons**: Less detailed tracking of each payment

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Tracking 6-Month Chit Payments

| Month | Name | Invested | Current | Status |
|-------|------|----------|---------|--------|
| Dec 2025 | "Gold Chit - M1" | ₹5,000 | ₹5,000 | Paid |
| Jan 2026 | "Gold Chit - M2" | ₹5,000 | ₹5,000 | Paid |
| Feb 2026 | "Gold Chit - M3" | ₹5,000 | ₹5,000 | Due Soon |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Dashboard shows**: ₹15,000 total invested in Chits

### Scenario 2: Chit Payout Received

If your turn comes and you receive ₹25,000 from the chit:

1. Edit one of the chit entries
2. Update Current Value to ₹25,000
3. This shows profit: ₹25,000 - ₹5,000 = ₹20,000 gain (example)

## Tracking by Month

### Using Month Filter

1. **Investments Tab** → Select month (e.g., 2025-12)
2. See all chit payments made that month
3. **Dashboard** → Select month
4. View total chit investments for that period

### Example:
- **Filter to 2025-12**: See December chit payment
- **Filter to 2026-01**: See January chit payment
- **Compare trends**: Switch months to see payment history

## Tips for Better Chit Tracking

### 1. **Naming Convention**
- ✅ Good: "Gold Chit - 30M - Month 1"
- ✅ Good: "Housing Chit - Jan 2025"
- ❌ Avoid: Just "Chit" (too vague)

### 2. **Date Accuracy**
- Always use the actual payment date (e.g., 2025-12-05)
- Makes it easy to filter by month
- Shows payment history clearly

### 3. **Current Value Updates**
- Update after receiving payout
- Update if chit offers interest/dividend
- Shows profit/loss at a glance

### 4. **Multiple Chits**
- Use different names for different chit groups
- Example: "Gold Chit", "Housing Chit", "Appliance Chit"
- Makes it easy to track which chit is which

## Advanced: Calculating Returns

Once chit is complete:

1. **Total Invested**: Sum of all payments
   - Example: ₹5,000 × 30 months = ₹150,000

2. **Amount Received**: Payout from chit
   - Example: ₹162,000

3. **Profit**: ₹162,000 - ₹150,000 = ₹12,000

4. **Return %**: (₹12,000 / ₹150,000) × 100 = 8%

## FAQ

**Q: Should I track the actual return or just the payment?**
A: Track both! Initial entries show payment, then update current value when payout received.

**Q: Can I have multiple chits at once?**
A: Yes! Use different names (e.g., "Gold Chit", "Housing Chit") to track multiple groups.

**Q: What if I miss a month's payment?**
A: Simply don't create an entry for that month. The next payment will show the gap.

**Q: How do I see all chit payments?**
A: Go to **Investments tab** → Change **Type filter** (when added) or scroll through the list. Search by "Chit" in the name.

**Q: Can I track pending chit amounts?**
A: Yes! In the name, add status like "Chit - Month 1 (Pending)" to track which are due.
